## Introduction to Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists offer dynamic memory allocation, efficient insertions and deletions, and are commonly used in various applications.

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of linked lists, including different types and their basic operations.

## Types of Linked Lists

There are several types of linked lists, including:
- Singly Linked Lists
- Doubly Linked Lists
- Circular Linked Lists

This repository explores each type of linked list and provides examples for better understanding.

## Basic Operations

Linked lists support various operations, such as:
- Insertion (at the beginning, end, or at a specific position)
- Deletion (from the beginning, end, or a specific position)
- Traversal
- Searching
- Counting elements

The repository explains how to perform these operations in C++.

## Implementations

This repository includes C++ implementations of linked lists for each type. You can explore the code to see how linked lists are implemented and how they can be used in your applications.
